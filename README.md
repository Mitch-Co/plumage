# Plumage
This app performs a sentiment analysis on Twitter posts.

This was a research project I did under supervision of a SoCS prof.â€”you can read the journal [here](https://github.com/jnguyen1098/plumage/blob/master/Quarantine%20Quibbles%20-%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20COVID-19%20Tweets.pdf).

You should probably install the dependencies (`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`)

You need a file called `tokeninfo` with four lines:
- Consumer key
- Consumer secret
- Access token
- Access secret

After this, you can run a demo using the `makefile` by executing `make demo`.
